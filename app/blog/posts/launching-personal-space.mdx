I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, ideas, and experiences with the world again.

This page is a placeholder for now, and it feels anxiety-inducing to share it already. But, as the saying goes, "the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

So, let's go!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
