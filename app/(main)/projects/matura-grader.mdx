# Matura Grader

Generic LLMs are great at chatting, but mediocre at grading according to a strict rubric.

If a student pastes their essay into ChatGPT, it often hallucinates outdated criteria (e.g., using the pre-2023 50-point scale instead of the current 35). It gives more of a "thumbs up" instead of a rigorous breakdown a teacher provides.

To that end - I just released MaturaGrader.

It helps Polish students grade their practice essays for the "Matura" exam (SAT/A-Level equivalent). It parses the essay, runs it against the official, up-to-date rubrics using Gemini 3.0 Pro, and returns a precise score breakdown.

To keep this free for students without burning my API credits, I had to implement a 3-layer custom abuse prevention system (I’ll share a technical deep dive on that architecture soon).
