# Go Figure

I've got invited to the Design Nature residency as an AI Expert.

My task is to help traditional artists bridge the gap between physical design and generative AI.

Generative 2D feels like a solved problem now. The goal here was to touch the 3D world—carving wood with CNC, running 3D printers...

So to prepare, I prototyped a workflow that turns flat images into Funko-pop style 3D printable models.

I couldn't believe my eyes when it just worked.
