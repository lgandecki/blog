summary: "A custom video player for sharing coding sessions with activity tracking."

I often find myself wanting to "time travel" through my previous coding sessions.
I write a lot of code, and finding some of the snippets I wrote years ago (and often even a few weeks back) is a pain.
I wanted to do this in a way that would be safe to share with the world.
And also, I figured, if I optimize for great experience for others, it would work great for myself too.

So I built [Sessions](https://sessions.lgandecki.net/demo).

The backend is a native MacOS app that records the video while excluding the apps I don't want to record.
The frontend is a custom video player that allows me to scrub through the video and see the activities, which app I was in and what I was doing, synced to the video.

The activities are tracked from my system (app names, window titles, file paths) and displayed alongside the video. Click any activity to jump to that moment.

Check out the [demo](https://sessions.lgandecki.net/demo) to see it in action.

More sessions coming soon.
