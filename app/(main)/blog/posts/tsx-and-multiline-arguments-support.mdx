### Multiline Step Arguments:

Thanks to @Enrico126 it allows usage of multiline step arguments, as showcased with a simple .feature example:

```typescript
Scenario Outline: DocString
    When I use DocString with argument like this:
      """
      Hey,
      You have been granted <Role> rights.
      -The Admins
      """
    Then I should have a string with argument "<Role>"

   Examples:
    |  Role     |
    |  Manager  |
    |  Admin    |
```

and matching step definition:

```typescript
let argString = "";

When("I use DocString with argument like this:", (dataString) => {
  argString = dataString;
});

Then(/^I should have a string with argument "([^"]*)"$/, function (argument) {
  expect(argString).to.contain(argument);
});
```

TSX support:

Thanks to @mallison you should be able to use .tsx files as your step definitions. As noted by @azamuddin this change also allows the use of @cypress/react to test react components in isolation with cucumber.

Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts in the comments below.

We've just released a new version of the cypress-cucumber-preprocessor package.
