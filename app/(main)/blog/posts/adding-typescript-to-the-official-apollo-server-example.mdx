In today's video, I go through the preparation of the official Apollo Platform Tutorial App ( [https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial](https://github.com/apollographql/fullstack-tutorial?ref=xolvio.ghost.io) ) for adding Chimp to it. I decided to divide that task into two steps - the first is adding TypeScript to the codebase. This way I will be able to demonstrate the process of adding Chimp in a much more concise and understandable way - without spending half of the time on fighting with types.

This is an uncut version of me doing the work - it's a bit smoother than it should be because I've done half of the work before trying to add Chimp and TypeScript at the same time - nonetheless you can see my workflow and learn some tricks :)

Around the 35-minute mark, I had to do a bit of a fight with Generic, I used quokka and quick prototyping to get out of that mess, which can be interesting to watch.

I hope you enjoy it. :-)
