We are happy to announce that the example showing many advanced patterns related to GraphQL usage is updated to Chimp 3.0 and it is available as a reference here: [https://github.com/xolvio/chimp-gql-federation-example](https://github.com/xolvio/chimp-gql-federation-example?ref=xolvio.ghost.io)

That repository includes federation, pagination with relay standard, filtering, caching, permissioning, JVM-based microservices and a typed react-based frontend

[Please take a look at chimp documentation for more info](https://www.chimpjs.com/docs/Examples/Federation?ref=xolvio.ghost.io)
