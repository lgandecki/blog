With the new version [chimp](https://www.chimpjs.com/?ref=xolvio.ghost.io) allows you to set up custom prefixes for your chimp apps. That will allow you to work in a monorepo structure, without some tooling getting confused by the conflicting aliasing.
When creating apps make sure to pass the new optional arguments, like so:

```typescript
npx chimp gql:create admin '~admin' '~admin-generated'
```

If you create a new app that will be done for you automatically, but if you decide to add different prefixes to an existing app, make sure your code generator script reflects that for example:\

```typescript
chimp gql:generate '~admin' '~admin-generated'
```

Take a look at this repo to see working code:
