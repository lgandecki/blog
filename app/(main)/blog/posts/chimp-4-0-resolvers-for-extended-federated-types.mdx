The Chimp 3.0 and previous versions always generated resolveReferences resolvers for all federated types - the types that were annotated with `@key`, like so:

```graphql
extend type SomeFederatedType @key(fields: "uuid") { }
```

Add @compute now to it to keep the previous functionality:
make sure your chimp-graphql-codegen-plugin version dependency is at least 0.2.0

We've noticed that that resolver was frequently unused and left a significant amount of unnecessary code in projects (resolvers + tests).

If you want to keep the previous functionality, mark all federated types with @compute.

```typescript
extend type SomeFederatedType @key(fields: "uuid") @computed { }
```

If you do have unnecessary files produced by previous versions of chimp you can remove them now safely.

Make sure your chimp-graphql-codegen-plugin version dependency is at least 0.2.0, otherwise the codegen tool will complain that you are using the `@computed` directive incorrectly.

Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts in the comments below.
